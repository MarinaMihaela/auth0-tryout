Cloning Development Tenant Settings to a Production Tenant

To replicate your development tenant's configuration—including roles, permissions, applications, APIs, actions, and branding—to a production tenant, Auth0 provides the Deploy CLI tool. This tool facilitates the export and import of tenant configurations, enabling seamless migration across environments.
Steps to Clone Tenant Settings:
Install the Deploy CLI:
Ensure you have Node.js installed.
Install the Deploy CLI globally using npm:

npm install -g auth0-deploy-cli

Export Configuration from Development Tenant:
Create a configuration file (config-dev.json) with your development tenant's domain and credentials.
Use the Deploy CLI to export the tenant's configuration:

a0deploy export --config_file config-dev.json --output_folder path/to/export

Prepare the Exported Data:
Review the exported files to ensure all necessary resources are included.
Modify any environment-specific settings, such as callback URLs or secrets, to align with the production environment.
Import Configuration into Production Tenant:
Create a configuration file (config-prod.json) with your production tenant's domain and credentials.
Use the Deploy CLI to import the configuration:

a0deploy import --config_file config-prod.json --input_file path/to/export


Considerations:
Environment-Specific Values: Ensure that values specific to the development environment are updated appropriately for production.

Feature Flags: Be aware that certain tenant-specific feature flags may not transfer automatically. It's advisable to verify and configure these settings manually in the production tenant as needed.
Auth0 Community
Testing: After importing, thoroughly test the production tenant to confirm that all configurations function as intended.
