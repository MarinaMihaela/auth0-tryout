 Install and Prepare Auth0 Deploy CLI
Install Auth0 Deploy CLI: You need Node.js installed on your machine. Then, install the CLI tool globally:

npm install -g auth0-deploy-cli


Create an Auth0 Application for Management API:

Go to the Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0 Dashboard.
Navigate to Applications > Applications and create a new application of type Machine-to-Machine (M2M).
Name the application, e.g., Deploy CLI Integration.
Authorize this application to access Auth0 Management API and select the necessary permissions:
read:clients, update:clients, create:clients, delete:clients
read:connections, update:connections
read:tenant_settings, update:tenant_settings
(Adjust permissions based on what you need.)
Get the client_id and client_secret:

After creating the M2M application, go to the Settings section.
Copy the Client ID and Client Secret — these are needed for the configuration files.


Step-by-Step Guide for Using Auth0 Deploy CLI and Syncing Configurations Between Environments (Dev, Stage, Prod)
This guide explains how to use Auth0 Deploy CLI for managing configurations across environments like dev, stage, and prod.

1. Install and Prepare Auth0 Deploy CLI
Install Auth0 Deploy CLI: You need Node.js installed on your machine. Then, install the CLI tool globally:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g auth0-deploy-cli
Create an Auth0 Application for Management API:

Go to the Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0 Dashboard.
Navigate to Applications > Applications and create a new application of type Machine-to-Machine (M2M).
Name the application, e.g., Deploy CLI Integration.
Authorize this application to access Auth0 Management API and select the necessary permissions:
read:clients, update:clients, create:clients, delete:clients
read:connections, update:connections
read:rules, update:rules, create:rules, delete:rules
read:tenant_settings, update:tenant_settings
(Adjust permissions based on what you need.)
Get the client_id and client_secret:

After creating the M2M application, go to the Settings section.
Copy the Client ID and Client Secret — these are needed for the configuration files.
2. Configure Auth0 Deploy CLI Files
For each environment (dev, stage, prod), create a YAML file to store the credentials and settings specific to that environment.

3. Export Configuration from dev
Use the following command to export configurations from the dev environment:

4. Edit the Exported Configurations (Optional)
Inside the ./exported-config folder, you'll find JSON/YAML files representing your configurations:

clients/: Your Auth0 applications (clients).
rules/: Custom rules.
connections/: Configurations for databases, social logins, etc.
tenant.json: Global tenant settings.
If you need to make manual adjustments (e.g., change callback URLs, add new rules), do it here.

5. Import Configuration to stage
Once the configuration is exported and verified, import it into the stage environment:

7. Sync Your Application with Auth0

Dynamic Configurations for Environments: In your application, create a configuration file or system to map Auth0 settings to environments.

8. Automate the Process with CI/CD
To reduce manual effort, integrate this workflow into a CI/CD pipeline.
